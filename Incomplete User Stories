Teams fret over the work they put in on incomplete stories resulting from not getting credit for the progress they made thus far, or even if the story is cancelled.  Potential Issues:
* Team is more focused on ‘point credit’ and velocity numbers rather than creating the value from the story.
* Story is tactical, reflecting more to-do’s than value for a customer/user.
* Other possibilities:
  * Misaligned with Agile Manifesto
  * Misaligned with Scrum Guide
  * Iterations are to be immutable
  * Team isn’t cross-functional to the extent needed
  * Product Owner not available for quick decisions and clarity
